Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark
📌 Objective

The goal of this task is to capture live network packets using Wireshark, analyze them, and identify basic protocols and traffic types.

🛠️ Tools Used

Wireshark (Free, open-source network protocol analyzer)

📂 Deliverables

capture.pcap → Packet capture file

report.pdf → Short report with identified protocols and packet analysis

🔎 Steps Performed

Installed and configured Wireshark.

Selected the active network interface and started live capture.

Generated network traffic (ping, DNS lookup, browsing websites).

Stopped the capture after ~1 minute.

Filtered packets by protocol (DNS, HTTP, TCP, ICMP, TLS).

Identified at least 3 different protocols with packet details.

Exported the capture file (.pcap).

Summarized findings in the report.

📊 Protocols Identified

DNS – Domain name queries and responses

HTTP/HTTPS (TLS) – Web browsing traffic

ICMP – Ping requests and replies

(You can add ARP/TCP if seen in your capture)

✅ Outcome

Hands-on experience with Wireshark packet capture and protocol analysis.

Improved understanding of how different network protocols operate.
